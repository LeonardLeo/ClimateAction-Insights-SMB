- Exploring Insight-Driven Motivation for SMB Climate Action -
- Objective

Using the provided dataset containing company firmographics, financials, emissions, and profitable initiative (actions the company can take) recommendations, your goal is to uncover a viable **path from data to insight that nudges real-world behaviour: motivating an individual SMB (specifically a small- or medium-sized business, not a large enterprise) to take climate action**.
You'll be working under similar constraints to what you'd encounter at an early-stage startup: limited time, high ambiguity, and a need for directionally strong signal fast.

# 3) ---> Analysis:
    - Correlation between EMPLOYEES and EMISSIONS_t_CO2e
    - Correlation between TURNOVER and EMPLOYEES (Is there a case for pushing an increase or increase in employees)
    - Correlation between TURNOVER and EMISSIONS_t_CO2e. Why this matters for SMB Climate Action:
            1) If bigger revenue = more emissions: Incentivize cleaner growth models.
            2) If no pattern: Climate action strategies must be industry-specific, not just based on size.
            3) If high earners emit less: Share best practices тАФ make decarbonization aspirational and profitable.
      Some important caveats to this analysis:
            1) Correlation & Causation - It doesn't prove that turnover causes emissions or vice versa.
            2) Industry Context Matters - Manufacturing, logistics, and energy sectors naturally emit more COтВВ than software or consulting тАФ regardless of revenue.
            3) Check for Outliers - A few very large firms can skew correlation so consider using log-transformed data.
    - Causal Inference between EMPLOYEES and EMISSIONS_t_CO2e.
            This answers: Are companies with more employees really polluting more, or is that just because they're richer?тАЭ
    - Causal Inference between TURNOVER and EMPLOYEES.
            This answers: Does higher company revenue (turnover) cause a company to hire more people
    - Causal Inference between TURNOVER and EMISSIONS_t_CO2e. 
            This answers: What would emissions be if turnover were hypothetically changed (intervened on)?
            This answers: If SMBs grow financially, do emissions grow linearly or can clean growth be incentivized?
    - Will any of these analysis change if we switched the analysis to specific groupings
              EXAMPLE: Industry, Sector, Geography.
