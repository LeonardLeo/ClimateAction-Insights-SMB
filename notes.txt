- Exploring Insight-Driven Motivation for SMB Climate Action -
- Objective

Using the provided dataset containing company firmographics, financials, emissions, and profitable initiative (actions the company can take) recommendations, your goal is to uncover a viable **path from data to insight that nudges real-world behaviour: motivating an individual SMB (specifically a small- or medium-sized business, not a large enterprise) to take climate action**.
You'll be working under similar constraints to what you'd encounter at an early-stage startup: limited time, high ambiguity, and a need for directionally strong signal fast.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Interpretation & Insights

1. Data Quality and Consistency
- Missing Values: No null values were identified across the dataset — indicating high data completeness and reliability.
- Duplicates: No duplicate rows were found, ensuring the dataset does not suffer from redundancies that could distort modeling or aggregation.
- Data Entry Consistency: No invalid or inconsistent entries were detected (e.g., negative employee counts, mislabelled sectors), suggesting appropriate validation or pre-cleaning.

2. Feature Engineering and Distributions
Several continuous features were found to be heavily left-skewed (non-normal), which may affect statistical modeling and correlation interpretation due to the influence of outliers and wide variance in scale:
- turnover
- employees
- emissions_t_CO2e
- initiative_carbon_savings_t_CO2e
- initiative_financial_savings_GBP
- initiative_capex_GBP

To mitigate this, a log1p transformation was applied, which helps:
- Normalize distributions
- Reduce the impact of extreme values
- Enhance linear relationship detection during correlation analysis

3. Correlation Insights (Post-Log Transformation)
3.1 Turnover ↔ Employees ↔ Emissions
- Turnover vs Employees: Moderately strong correlation (r ≈ 0.61)
    - Interpretation: Companies with higher turnover typically employ more staff, consistent with operational scale and business size dynamics.
- Employees vs Emissions: Moderate correlation (r ≈ 0.51)
    - Interpretation: Larger staff numbers may signal greater industrial or commercial activity, contributing to higher CO₂ emissions.
- Turnover vs Emissions: Moderate correlation (r ≈ 0.51)
    - Interpretation: Financially larger companies may engage in more energy-intensive processes, hence higher emissions. This relationship supports targeting mid- to high-turnover SMBs for decarbonization incentives.

3.2 Initiative Financials and Savings
- Initiative Capex vs Financial Savings: Strong correlation (r ≈ 0.61)
    - Interpretation: Investment in carbon-saving initiatives tends to scale with expected or realized financial savings. This supports the business case for green investment, a strong motivation lever for SMBs.
- Carbon Savings vs Financial Savings: Moderate correlation (r ≈ 0.37)
    - Interpretation: Initiatives that offer higher CO₂ reduction potential often correlate with better financial outcomes, although not always — indicating that carbon savings don't necessarily align perfectly with financial gain, but often do.

3.3 Miscellaneous
- Other inter-feature correlations (all < 0.30) were weak, implying lower direct dependency or variance explanation across these variables.

4. Data Readiness
- Columns were renamed for better readability and clarity (e.g., initiative_capex_GBP instead of cryptic names).
- Irrelevant or redundant columns (e.g., internal IDs, overly sparse categorical identifiers) were marked for removal to streamline downstream analyses.

Key Takeaways for Stakeholders
1. Business-Scale Matters: Turnover and employee size are strong predictors of CO₂ emissions. Tailoring messaging and actions based on company scale may increase engagement effectiveness.
2. Green = Profitable (Often): The positive correlation between initiative capital costs and financial returns strengthens the case for SMBs to take climate action for financial gain — not just sustainability.
3. Initiatives Show Mixed Carbon ROI: While some initiatives yield both carbon and financial benefits, others may be stronger in one dimension. SMBs might need segmented guidance depending on their motivation (profit vs sustainability).
4. Data Is Reliable and Actionable: With no major quality issues, this dataset is suitable for modeling or behavioral targeting — enabling next steps like segmentation, recommendation systems, or impact prediction.
    
    
# 3) ---> Analysis:
    - Correlation between EMPLOYEES and EMISSIONS_t_CO2e
    - Correlation between TURNOVER and EMPLOYEES (Is there a case for pushing an increase or increase in employees)
    - Correlation between TURNOVER and EMISSIONS_t_CO2e. Why this matters for SMB Climate Action:
            1) If bigger revenue = more emissions: Incentivize cleaner growth models.
            2) If no pattern: Climate action strategies must be industry-specific, not just based on size.
            3) If high earners emit less: Share best practices тАФ make decarbonization aspirational and profitable.
      Some important caveats to this analysis:
            1) Correlation & Causation - It doesn't prove that turnover causes emissions or vice versa.
            2) Industry Context Matters - Manufacturing, logistics, and energy sectors naturally emit more COтВВ than software or consulting тАФ regardless of revenue.
            3) Check for Outliers - A few very large firms can skew correlation so consider using log-transformed data.
    - Causal Inference between EMPLOYEES and EMISSIONS_t_CO2e.
            This answers: Are companies with more employees really polluting more, or is that just because they're richer?тАЭ
    - Causal Inference between TURNOVER and EMPLOYEES.
            This answers: Does higher company revenue (turnover) cause a company to hire more people
    - Causal Inference between TURNOVER and EMISSIONS_t_CO2e. 
            This answers: What would emissions be if turnover were hypothetically changed (intervened on)?
            This answers: If SMBs grow financially, do emissions grow linearly or can clean growth be incentivized?
