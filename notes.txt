- Exploring Insight-Driven Motivation for SMB Climate Action -
- Objective

Using the provided dataset containing company firmographics, financials, emissions, and profitable initiative (actions the company can take) recommendations, your goal is to uncover a viable **path from data to insight that nudges real-world behaviour: motivating an individual SMB (specifically a small- or medium-sized business, not a large enterprise) to take climate action**.
You'll be working under similar constraints to what you'd encounter at an early-stage startup: limited time, high ambiguity, and a need for directionally strong signal fast.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Interpretation & Insights

1. Data Quality and Consistency
- Missing Values: No null values were identified across the dataset — indicating high data completeness and reliability.
- Duplicates: No duplicate rows were found initially in the data, ensuring the dataset does not suffer from redundancies that could distort modeling or aggregation.
- Data Entry Consistency: No invalid or inconsistent entries were detected (e.g., negative employee counts, mislabelled sectors), suggesting appropriate validation or pre-cleaning.

2. Feature Engineering and Distributions
Several continuous features were found to be heavily left-skewed (non-normal), which may affect statistical modeling and correlation interpretation due to the influence of outliers and wide variance in scale:
- turnover
- employees
- emissions_t_CO2e
- initiative_carbon_savings_t_CO2e
- initiative_financial_savings_GBP
- initiative_capex_GBP

To mitigate this, a log1p transformation was applied, which helps:
- Normalize distributions
- Reduce the impact of extreme values
- Enhance linear relationship detection during correlation analysis

3. Correlation Insights (Post-Log Transformation)
3.1 Turnover ↔ Employees ↔ Emissions
- Turnover vs Employees: Moderately strong correlation (r ≈ 0.61)
    - Interpretation: Companies with higher turnover typically employ more staff, consistent with operational scale and business size dynamics.
- Employees vs Emissions: Moderate correlation (r ≈ 0.51)
    - Interpretation: Larger staff numbers may signal greater industrial or commercial activity, contributing to higher CO₂ emissions.
- Turnover vs Emissions: Moderate correlation (r ≈ 0.51)
    - Interpretation: Financially larger companies may engage in more energy-intensive processes, hence higher emissions. This relationship supports targeting mid- to high-turnover SMBs for decarbonization incentives.

3.2 Initiative Financials and Savings
- Initiative Capex vs Financial Savings: Strong correlation (r ≈ 0.61)
    - Interpretation: Investment in carbon-saving initiatives tends to scale with expected or realized financial savings. This supports the business case for green investment, a strong motivation lever for SMBs.
- Carbon Savings vs Financial Savings: Moderate correlation (r ≈ 0.37)
    - Interpretation: Initiatives that offer higher CO₂ reduction potential often correlate with better financial outcomes, although not always — indicating that carbon savings don't necessarily align perfectly with financial gain, but often do.

3.3 Miscellaneous
- Other inter-feature correlations (all < 0.30) were weak, implying lower direct dependency or variance explanation across these variables.

4. Data Readiness
- Columns were renamed for better readability and clarity (e.g., initiative_capex_GBP instead of cryptic names).
- Irrelevant or redundant columns (e.g., internal IDs, overly sparse categorical identifiers) were marked for removal to streamline downstream analyses.

Key Takeaways for Stakeholders
1. Business-Scale Matters: Turnover and employee size are strong predictors of CO₂ emissions. Tailoring messaging and actions based on company scale may increase engagement effectiveness.
2. Green = Profitable (Often): The positive correlation between initiative capital costs and financial returns strengthens the case for SMBs to take climate action for financial gain — not just sustainability.
3. Initiatives Show Mixed Carbon ROI: While some initiatives yield both carbon and financial benefits, others may be stronger in one dimension. SMBs might need segmented guidance depending on their motivation (profit vs sustainability).
4. Data Is Reliable and Actionable: With no major quality issues, this dataset is suitable for modeling or behavioral targeting — enabling next steps like segmentation, recommendation systems, or impact prediction.
    
    
# 3) ---> Analysis:
    - Correlation between EMPLOYEES and EMISSIONS_t_CO2e
    - Correlation between TURNOVER and EMPLOYEES (Is there a case for pushing an increase or increase in employees)
    - Correlation between TURNOVER and EMISSIONS_t_CO2e. Why this matters for SMB Climate Action:
            1) If bigger revenue = more emissions: Incentivize cleaner growth models.
            2) If no pattern: Climate action strategies must be industry-specific, not just based on size.
            3) If high earners emit less: Share best practices тАФ make decarbonization aspirational and profitable.
      Some important caveats to this analysis:
            1) Correlation & Causation - It doesn't prove that turnover causes emissions or vice versa.
            2) Industry Context Matters - Manufacturing, logistics, and energy sectors naturally emit more COтВВ than software or consulting тАФ regardless of revenue.
            3) Check for Outliers - A few very large firms can skew correlation so consider using log-transformed data.

# 4) Final Analysis, Results, and Conclusions:
    The dataset given was preprocessed for analysis and machine learning seperately. When preprocessing the data for data analysis, the goal was to create a dashboard where SMB's could go to and gain data-driven insights on various 
industries or that specific to them and then be able to draw insights on the key metrics such as average emissions, total initiatives implemented in that industry, average financial savings from implemneting initiatives, as well as average carbon
savings from implementing initiatives, etc.
    
    EDA:
    1) Initial dataset was clean with no duplicates, missing values, or data entry issues found.
    2) While eploring the data, we made some assumptions on certain variables:
            - There is a correlation between number of employees and emissions CO2e
            - There is a correlation between turnover and emissions CO2
            - There is a correlation between total_initiative_carbon_savings_t_CO2e and total_initiative_financial_savings_GBP.
    Initially conducting correlation tests on the dataset without any preprocessing leads to inaccurate results. This was largely due to the fact that alot of our features were highly skewed to the left and this had to be fixed.
    A log-transformation was done on skewd features before correlation was done and this revealed positive correlations between:
    - turnover and emissions CO2e (0.51)
    - total_initiative_carbon_savings_t_CO2e and emissions CO2 (0.85)
    - turnover and employees (0.6)
    - turnover and total_initiative_carbon_savings_t_CO2e (0.56)
    - turnover and total_initiative_financial_savings_GBP (0.64)
    - turnover and total_initiative_capex_GDP (0.52)
    - total_initiative_carbon_savings_t_CO2e and total_initiative_financial_savings_GBP (0.84)
    - employees and total_initiative_carbon_savings_t_CO2e (0.53)
    - employees and total_initiative_financial_savings_GBP (0.67)
    - emissions CO2 and total_initiative_financial_savings_GBP (0.70)
    - emissions CO2 and total_initiative_capex_GDP (0.71)
    etc (Full list can be seen in grouped correlation summary) 
    
    This correlation results provides insights on the following:
    These correlations help to uncover the relationships between company-level characteristics and their decarbonization initiative outcomes. For instance, the moderate 
    correlation between turnover and emissions (0.51) suggests that higher-revenue companies tend to emit more CO₂, likely due to their scale of operations. A strong 
    positive correlation between total initiative carbon savings and emissions (0.85) indicates that firms with higher emissions also tend to achieve greater absolute 
    carbon savings, possibly because they have more room for efficiency gains. The relationship between turnover and employees (0.60) reflects that larger firms 
    typically have more staff. Additionally, turnover correlates moderately with carbon savings (0.56), financial savings (0.64), and capex (0.52)—suggesting that higher-revenue 
    firms are generally investing more and saving more through initiatives.

    Further, carbon savings and financial savings are strongly correlated (0.84), implying that initiatives with environmental benefits often yield cost savings as well. Similar 
    moderate-to-strong relationships are observed between employees and both carbon savings (0.53) and financial savings (0.67), as well as between emissions and financial savings 
    (0.70) or capex (0.71). These results collectively indicate that larger, higher-emitting firms tend to pursue larger-scale decarbonization projects that yield both 
    environmental and financial benefits.

    FURTHER EDA ANALYSIS:
    Upon further inspection, more analysis was done on the extent of the correlation between the various variables to aid companies make better decisions. Another correlation analysis
    was done on filtered subsets of the data. This filtering was done for each location and for each industry where we learn how these variables interact with each other in more granular
    circumstances.
    The results can be seen in the correlation_preprocessed_data_summary_report.txt file.
