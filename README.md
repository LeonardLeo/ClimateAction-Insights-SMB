# ClimateAction-Insights-SMB
 ClimateAction-Insights-SMB is a data-driven project designed to help small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) take meaningful climate action. Leveraging company firmographics, financials, emissions data, and actionable initiative recommendations, this project explores how insights can be used to nudge real-world behavior toward sustainability.  The goal is to build a fast, insight-to-impact pipeline: from raw data → to tailored insights → to practical, profitable climate action. This is especially focused on making climate action accessible, realistic, and motivating for SMBs with limited resources.
